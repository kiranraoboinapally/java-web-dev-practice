### **How to Ignore Untracked Files in Git**

1. **Add to `.gitignore`**:

   * Ensure the files or directories you want to ignore are listed in `.gitignore`. Example:

     ```bash
     /.metadata/
     back/tasksTODO.md
     back/README.md
     ```

2. **Untracked Files**:

   * Files marked in **red** by `git status` are **untracked** (not staged or committed yet).
   * These files are **ignored from future commits** once added to `.gitignore`.

3. **Clean Up Untracked Files**:

   * To remove untracked files that are ignored (and not tracked by Git), use:

     ```bash
     git clean -fdX
     ```
   * `-f` forces the operation, `-d` removes untracked directories, `-X` cleans only ignored files.

4. **Check Status**:

   * After cleaning up, run `git status` to ensure those files are no longer showing in red (untracked).

5. **Notes**:

   * Files in `.gitignore` won't be added to version control if untracked.
   * Once added, Git ignores them permanently unless `.gitignore` is modified.

## ✅ Situation Summary

* You have two branches: `branch1` and `branch2`.
* In `branch1`, you created and committed `file1` and `file2`.
* You then switched to `branch2` and created `file3` (without committing immediately).
* While on `branch2`, you saw `file3` listed even in `branch1` (before committing).
* Then you committed `file3` in `branch2`.
* Now you switched back to `branch1` and `file3` disappeared — it's not visible in `branch1`.

## 📋 Explanation Table

| Step | Current Branch | Action Taken                                   | Files in Working Directory             | Git Status / Reason                                                                          |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `branch1`      | Create `file1`, `file2` and commit             | `file1`, `file2`                       | Committed in `branch1`                                                                       |
| 2    | `branch2`      | Checkout `branch2`                             | `file1`, `file2` (copied from branch1) | No changes yet in this branch                                                                |
| 3    | `branch2`      | Create `file3` (no commit)                     | `file1`, `file2`, `file3`              | `file3` is **untracked**, so it's present across branches for now                            |
| 4    | `branch1`      | Checkout `branch1` (before committing `file3`) | `file1`, `file2`, `file3`              | Since `file3` was uncommitted, Git keeps it as untracked                                     |
| 5    | `branch2`      | Commit `file3`                                 | `file1`, `file2`, `file3`              | Now `file3` is tracked in `branch2` only                                                     |
| 6    | `branch1`      | Checkout `branch1` again                       | `file1`, `file2` (no `file3`)          | `file3` is tracked only in `branch2` — so it's removed from working directory when switching |

## 🔍 Why `file3` disappeared?

* When `file3` was **untracked**, Git doesn’t control it — so it stays even when you change branches.
* Once `file3` is **committed** to `branch2`, it becomes **tracked by Git only in `branch2`**.
* When you switch to `branch1`, Git aligns your working directory to match that branch — and since `file3` is **not part of `branch1`**, it's removed from the working directory.

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Remember

| Concept               | Meaning                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Untracked file**    | Git doesn't care about it — it exists in all branches until deleted manually or tracked |
| **Tracked file**      | Git version-controls it — only appears in branches where it's committed                 |
| **Branch Checkout**   | Git updates working directory to reflect the files of the target branch                 |
| **Committing a file** | Links it to the current branch only                                                     |

## 🧪 You Can Try This

If you want to test and observe:

```bash
# Initialize a new repo
git init test-repo && cd test-repo

# Create and commit in branch1
git checkout -b branch1
echo "Hello" > file1 && echo "World" > file2
git add file1 file2 && git commit -m "Add file1 and file2"

# Switch to branch2 and create file3 (no commit)
git checkout -b branch2
echo "Branch2 file" > file3

# Observe file3 visible in both branches (untracked)
git checkout branch1   # file3 will still be there
ls                     # shows file1, file2, file3

# Commit file3 in branch2
git checkout branch2
git add file3 && git commit -m "Add file3"

# Now switch to branch1 again
git checkout branch1
ls  # file3 will be gone!
```
