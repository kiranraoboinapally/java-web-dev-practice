  * Configure a simple network interface and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

### 4. **Process Management**

* Learn how to manage processes:

  * `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `killall`, `pgrep`
  * **Systemd** basics: Learn how services are managed using **systemd** (service control with `systemctl`).
* Understanding **background processes** and **foreground processes**.
* Learn about **process priorities** with `nice` and `renice`.

### 5. **Log Management**

* Understand how logs work in Linux and where they are stored (e.g., `/var/log`).
* Learn how to view and analyze logs using `cat`, `less`, `tail`, `grep`.
* Learn about **log rotation** and managing logs with **logrotate**.
