To see databases in my system Syntax
mysql>show databases;

To create a new database Syntax
mysql>create database databasename;
Ex: create database college;

To use a database Syntax
mysql>use databasename;
Ex:use college;

To delete a database syntax
drop database databasename;
Ex:drop database college;

To create a table syntax:

create table tablename
(
col_name data_type, ......
);

Ex:
create table student
(
    sno int,
    name varchar(45),
    mobile int,
    email varchar(45),             //it also written in single quotes
    gender char                  //last should not keep comma char is written in single quotes as single character
);

Example:

create table jobs
(
    Jid int,
    Jname varchar(45),
    Jcategory varchar(45),
    Jqualification varchar(45)
);

mysql>expalin jobs;

Inserting in a table syntax
insert into tablename values(col1value,col2value...);

Example:
mysql>insert into jobs values(121,'Software','IT','Btech');
mysql>select * from jobs; //for selecting and displaying all coulmns in a table
mysql>select Jid,Jname from jobs; //for selecting and displaying specific coulmns in a table

Data types:
1.Numeric(only numbers)
---a.int
---b.double
---c.bigint
2.String(includes words or characters must be enclosed with in single quotes)
---a.char
---b.varchar() 
3.Date types: These should be compulsory null
---a.date
---b.datetime
---c.timestamp
---d.time

 Virtual Generation: Calculating the column values virtually
 (as is used for virtually generated column)

Virtually generated doesnt take constraints like not null,unique

---------------------------

Multiple insert :
It is a query which is used to insert multiple rows and omits default,virtually generated coulmns
Syntax

Insert into Tablename(cols) values(rowvalues)
Ex:

Create a student table with marks total marks virtually generated and percentage also

create table student
(
    roll int,
    name varchar(45),
    section char,
    mobile bigint,
    maxmarks int,
    s1 int,
    s2 int,
    s3 int,
    total int as (s1+s2+s3),   //virtually generated
    percentage double as (total/maxmarks*100)   //virtually generated
);

-------_------------


Multiple Insert:

mysql>insert into student(roll,name,section,mobile,maxmarks,s1,s2,s3) values(1,'Arjun','A',9893938,90,25,22,28),
-->(2,'Balu','B',982928,90,22,22,28);

---------------------

Constraints:
Conditions that are applied over coulmns

1.NOT NULL
2.CHECK:
specific condition to be applied on a column
3.Default
gender varchar(45) not null default 'female'
4.Unique:
Different value from all the remaining in that specific column

5.Primary key:
it must have not null and unique
not null+unique
In a table we must have zero or one primary key

6.Foreign key:
it can have duplicate values
in a table can have any number of foreign keys
a foreign key is a primary key in another table
a foreign key is used to join two or more tables
In child table primary key can have only one column


**NULL:
Which specifies that the value is not known
null value is not zero


create table student 
(
    roll int not null,
    name varchar(45) not null,
    email varchar(45) not null unique,
    gender char not null default 'm',  //if we have default we use multiple insert if not mismatch in columns and rowvalues
    age int not null check(age>=18)
);


foreign key  and primary key usage
example:
flipkart 

orders //(parent table)
oid oname oprice oquantity olocation
101 laptop 1200  1        hyd
102 mobile 1000  2        vjd
103 mouse  700   4        hyd

flipkart //(child table)
name email          mobile order_id cid
abc  abc@gmail.com  9848   103      1
pqr  pqr@gmail.com  9999   101      3
xyz  xyz@gmail.com  8888   101      4

customer
cid customerfeedback
1   good
2   worst
3   ok


How do we know both tables are connected ?
if we use delete row in parent table,If it doesnt delete records then it is said to be connected.

CREATE TABLE orders(
    oid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    oname VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    oprice INT NOT NULL,
    oquantity DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    olocation VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO orders VALUES

### Questions about the **Orders** Table:
1. **What are the details of all orders placed in 'Hyderabad'?**
   - Hint: Filter by `olocation = 'Hyderabad'`.

2. **Which order has the highest price and what product was it for?**
   - Hint: Use the `MAX` function on the `oprice` column.

3. **How many items were ordered in total?**
   - Hint: Sum the `oquantity` column.

4. **Which product was ordered the most (i.e., highest quantity)?**
   - Hint: Use `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to find the most ordered product.

5. **Which cities have orders that include the product 'Mobile'?**
   - Hint: Filter by `oname = 'Mobile'`.

### Questions about the **Flipkart** Table:
1. **List all customers who have placed an order in 'Hyderabad'.**
   - Hint: Join the `flipkart` and `orders` tables based on `order_id` and filter by `olocation`.

2. **Which customer ordered the product 'Camera'?**
   - Hint: Filter by `oname = 'Camera'` and join with `flipkart`.

3. **How many different customers placed an order for a 'Tablet'?**
   - Hint: Filter by `oname = 'Tablet'` and count distinct `email`.

4. **What are the details of all orders placed by 'John Doe'?**
   - Hint: Filter by `email = 'john.doe@gmail.com'` in the `flipkart` table.

5. **How many customers have placed more than one order?**
   - Hint: Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 1`.

### Questions about the **Customer** Table:
1. **What feedback did customer `cid = 2` leave?**
   - Hint: Filter by `cid = 2` in the `customer` table.

2. **How many customers left the feedback 'Good quality'?**
   - Hint: Filter by `cfeedback = 'Good quality'` and count the rows.

3. **List all feedback from customers who have placed an order in 'Chennai'.**
   - Hint: Join the `flipkart` and `orders` tables and filter by `olocation = 'Chennai'`.

4. **Which customers have given the feedback 'Great product'?**
   - Hint: Filter by `cfeedback = 'Great product'` in the `customer` table.

5. **How many unique feedback entries exist in the database?**
   - Hint: Use `DISTINCT` to count the unique feedback values in the `customer` table.

### More Advanced Questions (Join-Based):
1. **Which products were purchased by customers who gave feedback 'Worth the price'?**
   - Hint: Join `flipkart`, `orders`, and `customer` tables, and filter by `cfeedback = 'Worth the price'`.

2. **Find all customers who ordered both 'Smartphone' and 'Tablet'.**
   - Hint: Use a `GROUP BY` query with a `HAVING` clause to identify customers who have ordered both.

3. **What is the total amount spent by customer `cid = 1` on all orders?**
   - Hint: Join `flipkart` with `orders` on `order_id` and sum the `oprice` multiplied by `oquantity` for `cid = 1`.

4. **Which cities have customers who left feedback 'Good quality' and placed orders?**
   - Hint: Use a `JOIN` between `flipkart`, `orders`, and `customer`, and filter by `cfeedback = 'Good quality'`.

5. **How many orders were placed by customers who live in 'Chennai' and gave 'Average' feedback?**
   - Hint: Use a `JOIN` and filter by `olocation = 'Chennai'` and `cfeedback = 'Average'`.

Operators:

A operator is a symbol which is used to specify an operation that is being performed
there are 3 operators.

1.Arithmetic (+,-,/,%,x)
2.Relational (>,<,>=,<=,==,!=)
3.Logical (AND,OR,NOT)

Operators must be used only for columns
using select we can use all operators
using columns we can apply all operators 


mysql>select 17>10;
select 1+2;
...


-------------
Where is a clause which is used to filter the data. 

example: 
select * from zomato where id=102 or price=170;
select * from registration where not id=101;

AND operator is only used for row
OR operator will effect multiple rows. 


--------------


In multiple insert omitting
1. default
2. virtually generated
3. auto_increment


---------------------------



create table registration 
(
id int primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(45) not null,
email varchar(45) not null unique,
password varchar(45) not null, 
mobile bigint not null unique, 
gender char(1) not null
);



--------------------------------



DML:
Works with only records.

Insert a new record in the table.
Update modifies a new record.
Delete used to delete existing record.


------------------------

delete-from:

delete from registration where id=102;

to delete multiple records we use or ( don't use comma it used only for columns.)

Update to the set can be done by using only primary key.

-----------------------

update-set:

Syntax:
update tablename set colname=value where condition;

case-1: updating single column.

mysql>update registration set password='password' where id=101;

case-2: updating two or multiple columns in a one row

update registration set password='abcd123', mobile='9845' where id=102;

case-3: updating multiple records. 

update registration set password='xyz' where id=102 or 103;

case-4: updating whole table. 

update registration set password='pqr';
i.e.,
if we don't filter using where then the whole table will be update.

------------------6---------------


DDL:

These commands are applied only to columns and tables. 
We have to use a word called table in ddls.

In table:

1. create
2. drop
3. truncate
4. rename


truncate used to delete all the records existing in table.

For columns:
used on columns 

alter-add
alter-modify
alter-drop
alter-rename



rename table old to new;
rename table student to new_student;

---------------------------------

differences in delete truncate drop?

delete
1.It is a DML
truncate
1.It is a DDL
drop
1.It is a DDL

delete
2.Used to delete records in table
truncate
2.Used to delete data and keep the table structure as it is.
drop
2.Used to drop table as well as table structure.

delete
3.Use the where clause to delete particular records.
truncate
3.Cant use where clause to delete particular data.
drop
3.It cant use where clause.

delete
4.This statement can be rollback before the commit.
truncate
4.This statement cant rollback.
drop
4.This statement cant rollback.

delete
5.Delete is slower as compare to truncate. 
truncate
5.This is faster as compare to delete. 
drop
5.Drop removes table from database.

delete
6.It records deleted rows in the transactions log.
truncate
6.Since it removes the page where our tables data is stored,it stores the page in the transactions log.
drop
6.

delete
7.Trigger is fired.
truncate
7.Trigger is not fired
drop
7.


------------------

DDL commands for columns:

Alter:
Syntax
alter table table_name operation column column_name

example:
alter table student add column gender varchar(45) not null;

alter table student drop column gender;
//existing column will be deleted permanently.

alter table student modify column mobile bigint not null;

alter table student rename column gender to sgender;


alter table student add unique(email);
alter table student drop index mobile;
alter table student modify column mobile bigint not null unique;
alter table student drop primary key;
alter table student add primary key(roll);
--------------------

TCL Commands:
Commit: saves the transaction.
Rollback:transaction will be rolled back.
Save point: A savepoint is a point in a transaction in which you can roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction.

>set autocommit=0;---->it doesnt save automatically
---->temporary delete.

>set autocommit=1;---->permanently delete

>rollback;

Only DML should apply for autocommit i.e., TCL.

----------------------------------------------

Logical Operators:
--between ==>prints the range
--in ==> only selected rows will be displayed
--like ==>
--or ==> any one condition has to be true
--and ==> two conditions must be true
--not
--is null

Operators only must use with columns
Between:
between operator is used to compare the value in a column
example selecct * from students where age between 6 and 18; (only used on numeric data ypes)
In:
the in opeartor evaluates multiple values on a single data column
written as a word "IN" followed by multiole vvalues separated by comma inside brackets
exxample selcct * from studetn where age IN(5,6);
It can be usedd for numbers and string data types

Like:
a wild character is used as substitute for any characters in a string
the % means zero or more charcters and _ means exactly one charcter
exmaple select * from students where firstname Like 'Jo%';(zero or more)
selct * from students where firstname like 'Jo_';(exactly one)

the wild cards are used to search for data in a given column

----------------------------------------------

b.lower()
c.length()
d.instr()
e.trim()
f.substring()
g.concat()
h.reverse()
